# WPF_Rectangle

1. Select and load an image.
2. Draw one rectangle or more over the image by clicking and dragging the
mouse to draw (the size of the rectangle depends on how much the user
drags the mouse)
3. Only allow drawing inside the picture.
5. Resize the rectangle(s) and be able to drag-drop any of them. (There is a bug in this feature)
